The Bee Colony Optimization algorithm.

Written in pure ANSI Common Lisp, without any dependences.

The subject is a new (2005) and very efficient global optimization algorithm.
According to some tests (mine, among all), it is more efficient on a spherical
task in vacuum, than simple genetic algorithm, and is more unlikely to stop 
into local minima.

There is a number of modifications of the original algorithm, which allowed to
shorten the code seriously and make it more simple. Also the efficiency seems
to be better than the original.

This is a stable version.
BTW, there are some places, which could be done better,
among them local search with strongly limited bounds.
Also there is no optimization of vector operations. For real tasks the limitation
factor is calculating of goal function, so such optimizations are unnessesary.
